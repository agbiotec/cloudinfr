	Abstract = {The completion of the human genome project, and other genome sequencing
projects, has spearheaded the emergence of the field of bioinformatics.
Using computer programs to analyse DNA and protein information has
become an important area of life science research and development.
While it is not necessary for most life science researchers to develop
specialist bioinformatic skills (including software development),
basic skills in the application of common bioinformatics software
and the effective interpretation of results are increasingly required
by all life science researchers. Training in bioinformatics is increasingly
occurring within the university system as part of existing undergraduate
science and specialist degrees. One difficulty in bioinformatics
education is the sheer number of software programs required in order
to provide a thorough grounding in the subject to the student. Teaching
requires either a well-maintained internal server with all the required
software, properly interfacing with student terminals, and with sufficient
capacity to handle multiple simultaneous requests, or it requires
the individual installation and maintenance of every piece of software
on each computer. In both cases, there are difficult issues regarding
site maintenance and accessibility. In this article, we discuss the
use of BioManager, a web-based bioinformatics application integrating
a variety of common bioinformatics tools, for teaching, including
its role as the main bioinformatics training tool in some Australian
and international universities. We discuss some of the issues with
using a bioinformatics resource primarily created for research in
an undergraduate teaching environment.},

Although cloud computing technology is being heralded as a key enabling technology for the future of genomic research, available case studies are limited to applications in the domain of high-throughput sequence data analysis. The goal of this study was to evaluate the computational and economic characteristics of cloud computing in performing a large-scale data integration and analysis representative of research problems in genomic medicine. We find that the cloud-based analysis compares favorably in both performance and cost in comparison to a local computational cluster, suggesting that cloud computing technologies might be a viable resource for facilitating large-scale translational research in genomic medicine.},

Meeting humanity's projected demands for agricultural and forest products and the expectation that natural ecosystems be managed sustainably will require synergies from the application of information technologies. The iPlant cyberinfrastructure design is based on an unprecedented period of research community input, and leverages developments in high-performance computing, data storage, and cyberinfrastructure for the physical sciences. iPlant is an open-source project with application programming interfaces that allow the community to extend the infrastructure to meet its needs. iPlant is sponsoring community-driven workshops addressing specific scientific questions via analysis tool integration and hypothesis testing. These workshops teach researchers how to add bioinformatics tools and/or datasets into the iPlant cyberinfrastructure enabling plant scientists to perform complex analyses on large datasets without the need to master the command-line or high-performance computational services.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: A steep drop in the cost of next-generation sequencing during recent years has made the technology affordable to the majority of researchers, but downstream bioinformatic analysis still poses a resource bottleneck for smaller laboratories and institutes that do not have access to substantial computational resources. Sequencing instruments are typically bundled with only the minimal processing and storage capacity required for data capture during sequencing runs. Given the scale of sequence datasets, scientific value cannot be obtained from acquiring a sequencer unless it is accompanied by an equal investment in informatics infrastructure. RESULTS: Cloud BioLinux is a publicly accessible Virtual Machine (VM) that enables scientists to quickly provision on-demand infrastructures for high-performance bioinformatics computing using cloud platforms. Users have instant access to a range of pre-configured command line and graphical software applications, including a full-featured desktop interface, documentation and over 135 bioinformatics packages for applications including sequence alignment, clustering, assembly, display, editing, and phylogeny. Each tool's functionality is fully described in the documentation directly accessible from the graphical interface of the VM. Besides the Amazon EC2 cloud, we have started instances of Cloud BioLinux on a private Eucalyptus cloud installed at the J. Craig Venter Institute, and demonstrated access to the bioinformatic tools interface through a remote connection to EC2 instances from a local desktop computer. Documentation for using Cloud BioLinux on EC2 is available from our project website, while a Eucalyptus cloud image and VirtualBox Appliance is also publicly available for download and use by researchers with access to private clouds. CONCLUSIONS: Cloud BioLinux provides a platform for developing bioinformatics infrastructures on the cloud. An automated and configurable process builds Virtual Machines, allowing the development of highly customized versions from a shared code base. This shared community toolkit enables application specific analysis platforms on the cloud by minimizing the effort required to prepare and maintain them.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Almost all users encounter problems using sequence analysis
programs. Not only are they difficult to learn because of the parameters,
syntax and semantic, but many are different. That is why we have
developed a Web interface generator for more than 150 molecular biology
command-line driven programs, including: phylogeny, gene prediction,
alignment, RNA, DNA and protein analysis, motif discovery, structure
analysis and database searching programs. The generator uses XML
as a high-level description language of the legacy software parameters.
Its aim is to provide users with the equivalent of a basic Unix environment,
with program combination, customization and basic scripting through
macro registration.Results: The program has been used for three years
by about 15000 users throughout the world; it has recently been installed
on other sites and evaluated as a standard user interface for EMBOSS
programs.Availability: The program is freely available over the Internet

@article{Neron2009Mobyle,
	Abstract = {Motivation: For the biologist, running bioinformatics analyses involves

a time-consuming management of data and tools. Users need support

to organize their work, retrieve parameters and reproduce their analyses.

They also need to be able to combine their analytic tools using a

safe data flow software mechanism. Finally, given that scientific

tools can be difficult to install, it is particularly helpful for

biologists to be able to use these tools through a web user interface.

However, providing a web interface for a set of tools raises the

problem that a single web portal cannot offer all the existing and

possible services: it is the user, again, who has to cope with data

copy among a number of different services. A framework enabling portal

administrators to build a network of cooperating services would therefore

clearly be beneficial.Results: We have designed a system, Mobyle,

to provide a flexible and usable Web environment for defining and

running bioinformatics analyses. It embeds simple yet powerful data

management features that allow the user to reproduce analyses and

to combine tools using a hierarchical typing system. Mobyle offers

invocation of services distributed over remote Mobyle servers, thus

enabling a federated network of curated bioinformatics portals without

the user having to learn complex concepts or to install sophisticated

software. While being focused on the end user, the Mobyle system

also addresses the need, for the bioinfomatician, to automate remote

services execution: PlayMOBY is a companion tool that automates the

publication of BioMOBY web services, using Mobyle program definitions.Availability:

The Mobyle system is distributed under the terms of the GNU GPLv2

on the project web site (http://bioweb2.pasteur.fr/projects/mobyle/).

It is already deployed on three servers: http://mobyle.pasteur.fr,

http://mobyle.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr and http://lipm-bioinfo.toulouse.inra.fr/Mobyle.

MOWServ, the bioinformatic platform offered by the Spanish National Institute of Bioinformatics, was released to provide integrated access to databases and analytical tools. Since its release, the number of available services has grown dramatically, and it has become one of the main contributors of registered services in the EMBRACE Biocatalogue. The ontology that enables most of the web-service compatibility has been curated, improved and extended. The service discovery has been greatly enhanced by Magallanes software and biodataSF. User data are securely stored on the main server by an authentication protocol that enables the monitoring of current or already-finished user's tasks, as well as the pipelining of successive data processing services. The BioMoby standard has been greatly extended with the new features included in the MOWServ, such as management of additional information (metadata such as extended descriptions, keywords and datafile examples), a qualified registry, error handling, asynchronous services and service replication. All of them have increased the MOWServ service quality, usability and robustness. MOWServ is available at http://www.inab.org/MOWServ/ and has a mirror at http://www.bitlab-es.com/MOWServ/.},
