Training in bioinformatics is increasinglyoccurring within the university system as part of existing undergraduatescience and specialist degrees. One difficulty in bioinformaticseducation is the sheer number of software programs required in orderto provide a thorough grounding in the subject to the student. Teachingrequires either a well-maintained internal server with all the requiredsoftware, properly interfacing with student terminals, and with sufficientcapacity to handle multiple simultaneous requests, or it requiresthe individual installation and maintenance of every piece of softwareon each computer. In both cases, there are difficult issues regardingsite maintenance and accessibility.

Sequencing instruments are typically bundled with only the minimal processing and storage capacity required for data capture during sequencing runs. Given the scale of sequence datasets, scientific value cannot be obtained from acquiring a sequencer unless it is accompanied by an equal investment in informatics infrastructure. RESULTS: Cloud BioLinux is a publicly accessible Virtual Machine (VM) that enables scientists to quickly provision on-demand infrastructures for high-performance bioinformatics computing using cloud platforms. Users have instant access to a range of pre-configured command line and graphical software applications, including a full-featured desktop interface, documentation and over 135 bioinformatics packages for applications including sequence alignment, clustering, assembly, display, editing, and phylogeny. Each tool's functionality is fully described in the documentation directly accessible from the graphical interface of the VM. Besides the Amazon EC2 cloud, we have started instances of Cloud BioLinux on a private Eucalyptus cloud installed at the J. Craig Venter Institute, and demonstrated access to the bioinformatic tools interface through a remote connection to EC2 instances from a local desktop computer. Documentation for using Cloud BioLinux on EC2 is available from our project website, while a Eucalyptus cloud image and VirtualBox Appliance is also publicly available for download and use by researchers with access to private clouds. CONCLUSIONS: Cloud BioLinux provides a platform for developing bioinformatics infrastructures on the cloud. An automated and configurable process builds Virtual Machines, allowing the development of highly customized versions from a shared code base. This shared community toolkit enables application specific analysis platforms on the cloud by minimizing the effort required to prepare and maintain them.}, location = {J.

Users need supportto organize their work, retrieve parameters and reproduce their analyses.They also need to be able to combine their analytic tools using asafe data flow software mechanism. Finally, given that scientifictools can be difficult to install, it is particularly helpful forbiologists to be able to use these tools through a web user interface.However, providing a web interface for a set of tools raises theproblem that a single web portal cannot offer all the existing andpossible services: it is the user, again, who has to cope with datacopy among a number of different services. A framework enabling portaladministrators to build a network of cooperating services would thereforeclearly be beneficial.Results: We have designed a system, Mobyle,to provide a flexible and usable Web environment for defining andrunning bioinformatics analyses. It embeds simple yet powerful datamanagement features that allow the user to reproduce analyses andto combine tools using a hierarchical typing system. Mobyle offersinvocation of services distributed over remote Mobyle servers, thusenabling a federated network of curated bioinformatics portals withoutthe user having to learn complex concepts or to install sophisticatedsoftware.
