Sequencing technologies continue to move in a direction where throughput per run is
increasing while the cost per basepair is decreasing (review in \cite{Metzker2009). Several
technologies available on the market today produce massive volumes of sequence data per
run; for instance, one of the most widely used instruments in the field for the past few 
years, Illumina's GAIIx system can produce up to 35 Giga-base pair (Gbp) per run, while another
broadly used SOLiD sequencer has yields of 50 Gbp. With the latest generation of instruments 
including Illumina’s HiSeq 2000 technology the yield per run has been increased to  X Gbp 
\cite{ }, and with the the Pacific BioSciences instrument yields of X Gbp can be achieved
\cite{ }.

At the same time, the pricing of the technology has significantly dropped, with new generation of
smaller-factor, benchtop-based, less expensive sequencers (for example, GS Junior by 454 and 
MiSeq by Illumina \cite{},\cite{} that can be affordable for researchers running independent 
laboratories. Despite their smaller factor, these laboratory instruments still provide enough 
capacity for sequencing complete bacterial, small fungal and viral genomes, or multiple BACs and 
plasmids containing genic regions of interest, which in combination of the low cost will turn 
those techniques into commonplace for biological research. Applications of sequencing in several 
areas other areas of the biological research, include Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) 
variation discovery , gene expression analysis (RNAseq), DNA–protein interaction analysis 
(ChiPseq), and study of microbial communities from different environments (review of these 
techniques in \cite{Mardis2008}). The new generation of sequencing technologies is also being 
used in the area of metagenomics, for large-scale studies of uncultivated microbial communities. 
The J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) for example has been involved in several such metagenomic 
projects, including the Sorcerer II Global Ocean Sampling (GOS, \cite{}) expedition to study marine 
microbial diversity, and also the National Institutes of Health funded Human Microbiome Project 
to study human associated microbial communities \cite{}. 

While large datasets are generated during sequencing runs, sequencers are typically bundled 
with only minimal computational and storage capacity for data capture during the run. 
For example, the un-assembled reads returned from a single lane of the Illumina GAIIx instrument 
after base calling are approximately 100 GigaByte (GB) in size. Given the scale of datasets, 
scientific value cannot necessarily be obtained from the investment in a sequencing instrument,
unless it is accompanied by an equal investment in a large-scale bioinformatics infrastructure.
